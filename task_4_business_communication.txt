Subject: Data Quality Issues – Key Findings & Next Steps

Hey Team,

Hope you're doing well!

As we’ve been digging into the receipts, users, and brands data to answer key business questions, we came across a few data quality issues that could impact our reporting accuracy. I wanted to highlight them and get your thoughts on how we should move forward.

Key Findings:
Missing Data: Some receipts are missing critical fields like "purchaseDate" and "totalSpent", which makes it tricky to analyze spending patterns.
Date Anomalies: A few receipts have purchase dates that don’t align with expected processing timelines.
Duplicate User IDs: We found some users with duplicate accounts, which could skew insights around customer behavior.
Barcode Mismatches: Some receipts reference brands that aren’t in our brand dataset, which might lead to incomplete reporting on brand performance.

Suggested Fixes:
Should we infer missing "purchaseDate" and "totalSpent" values from other fields, or flag them as incomplete transactions?
Do we have a process to resolve barcode mismatches—should we validate receipts before ingestion or update the brand database?
What’s our approach for duplicate users? Should we merge them, or do we intentionally allow multiple accounts per user?

Why This Matters:
Better Data = Better Insights: Fixing these issues will ensure that our brand rankings and purchase analytics are accurate.
Scalability Concerns: If these inconsistencies aren’t addressed now, they could become bigger bottlenecks as we scale.
Impact on Users: Clean data means better user experience—accurate rewards, smoother transactions, and reliable insights.

Would love to get your input on this. Let me know if you have any questions.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,
